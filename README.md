# Hybrid RAG Using BM25: Better Option for AI Governance

Welcome to the **Hybrid RAG Guide**: a dual-memory (LT + HOT) Vector + BM25 approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation that delivers answers that are **transparent, deterministic, and governance-ready** by design. The repo houses two fully working paths:

* **Community / Open-Source Version**: a self-contained demo you can run on a laptop or in a pure open-source deployment.
* **Enterprise Version**: a production-grade variant that layers in ingest pipelines, NetApp FlexCache, SnapMirror, and other operational muscle.

By storing knowledge as **documents with enriched metadata** (named entities and provenance tags) instead of opaque vectors alone, the agent gains traceability, reduces hallucinations, and meets demanding audit requirements.

### Project Purpose

This project was developed to address limitations of traditional vector-centric RAG and to make retrieval **explainable** and **auditable**.

* **Performance & latency**: The LT/HOT split exists primarily for **governance boundaries**, **retention variations control**, and **policy asymmetry**; retrieval remains lexical-first and observable.
* **Transparency and Explainability**: Vector embeddings are opaque. Document-based RAG stores explicit entity metadata (`explicit_terms`, `explicit_terms_text`) and uses fielded, auditable BM25 queries so you can show *why* a document matched.

Key objectives include:

* Provide a reference architecture for **Document-based RAG** with explicit **HOT (unstable)** and **Long-Term (LT)** tiers.
* Make promotion from **HOT → LT** a **controlled event** that happens only when (1) there is **enough positive reinforcement** of the data **or** (2) a **trusted human-in-the-loop** has verified it.
* Show upgrade paths-from a minimal Python demo to an enterprise pipeline with NetApp enterprise storage.

## Benefits Over Vector-Based RAG

Adopting Document-based RAG addresses several key limitations of traditional RAG agents:

* **Multi-Step Reasoning**: OpenSearch indexing with entity enrichment supports complex, entity-aware queries across related documents.
* **Bias Mitigation**: Explicit metadata and annotations expose skew and make it easier to correct.
* **Improved Compliance and Governance**: Provenance fields and auditable clauses enable traceable, regulator-friendly retrieval.
* **Risk Management**: Deterministic lexical logic and highlights reduce hallucinations and make review straightforward.

### Community vs Enterprise: What Changes?

| Capability                 | Community Edition                             | Enterprise Edition                                                          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HOT backing store**      | `tmpfs` / RAM-disk on the dev box             | **NetApp FlexCache** for locality; durability via **SnapMirror** replicas   |
| **Governance hooks**       | Basic provenance tags                         | Promotion events logged, schema-versioned, and instantly traceable          |
| **Latency posture**        | Latency is secondary to governance boundaries | Latency tuned per SLA, but the split is for **governance/policy asymmetry** |

> **TL;DR:** start with the community guide for laptops and commodity hardware; switch to the enterprise path when you need multi-site, 24×7, and **governance** at scale. The split exists for **control and auditability**, not because latency forces it.
